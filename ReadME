Project Phases
Phase I [10 Marks]: Data Exploration and Model Implementation
Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
1. Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the datasets and handle missing values, outliers,
and inconsistencies.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
○ Visualize data distributions using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
○ Identify correlations between features.
○ Explore potential relationships between features and the target variable.
3. Feature Engineering:
○ Create new features or transform existing ones if necessary.
○ Handle categorical variables using appropriate encoding techniques.
○ Choose 20 most important features to work with.
○ Scale numerical features if required.

Task 2: Model Implementation
1. Implement 4 classification models, ensuring each model is applied to the most
appropriate dataset type. you can use these models but you are not limited to any of
them.
○ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
○ Logistic Regression
○ SVM
○ Random Forest
○ Decision Tree
2. Implement 1 ensembling technique, combining the predictions of multiple models to
make a stronger, more reliable prediction (e.g. Voting).

3. Model Training and Evaluation:
○ Train each model on the prepared dataset.
○ Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy,
precision, recall, F1-score, MSE, RMSE, MAE).
○ Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing
one.

Task 3: Report
The report must include the following:
● Problem Statement: Clearly define the problem and its significance.
● Data Exploration: Summarize key insights from the exploratory data analysis.
● Data Preprocessing: Describe the preprocessing steps taken, including handling
missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
● Model Selection and Implementation: Explain the rationale for choosing specific
models and provide details on the implementation.
● Model Evaluation: Present the performance evaluation results for each model,
including metrics and visualizations.
● Conclusion: Summarize the findings and discuss the limitations of the models.
Phase I Performance Evaluation and Grading:
Your performance in this phase will be evaluated based on the following:
1. Code Quality: Clarity, efficiency, and documentation.
2. Model Performance: Accuracy and generalizability of the models.
3. Data Analysis: Depth of analysis and insights derived from the data.
4. Report Writing: Clarity, organization, and presentation of results.
5. Code Explanation: Ability to explain the code and the rationale behind design
choices.
